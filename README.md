# Twtxtra
## twtxt, but with extras

### twtxt
This is a work in progress that is going to be a php implementation of a twtxt client/server thing.

A number of features will not be implemented:
 1. the file updating will be handled automatically, meaning that there will be no need for pre_tweet and post_tweet hooks.

Some things are planned that might be of questionable wisdom, but at the moment I don't want the hasstle of implementing a singin process. All twts are public, so privacy shouldn't be to big of an issue. I will probably have to come up with something for *posting* twts though...

### extras
As it says in the title, the name and in other places, various extras are planned. In fact, I plan to make this a framework to easily expand twtxt, adding features such as commentin on posts (maybe. If someone thinks it's a good idea and implements it. I think is strays to far from the spirit of twtxt), images, *formatting*, and other outlandish ideas.

Feel free to add to the TODO list, if you are willing to take on some of the load, or think it might be a good enough idea to distract me from the core.
