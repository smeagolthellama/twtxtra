# Twtxtra
## twtxt, but with extras

This is a work in progress that is going to be a php implementation of a twtxt client/server thing.

A number of features will not be implemented:
 1. the file updating will be handled automatically, meaning that there will be no need for pre_tweet and post_tweet hooks.

Some things are planned that might be of questionable wisdom, but at the moment I don't want the hasstle of implementing a singin process. All twts are public, so privacy shouldn't be to big of an issue. I will probably have to come up with something for *posting* twts though...
